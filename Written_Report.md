The "PyCitySchools" script merges two datasets of spending and standardized test outcomes. It creates new dataframes so that the analyst can identify trends in school performance. The analysis displays outcomes in various ways, including by district, school, school size, school type, and school spending, to isolate the relationship between student test scores and these factors.


One conclusion from the calculations is that student outcomes in math and reading are inversely correlated to the school size. Particularly, when the school size rises over 2,000 students, the percent of students who pass math and reading declines noticeably. This information could potentialy inform policy on the structuring of schools. However, we would also need to look at additional information to make a better inference. For example, we could further break down the "school size" bins, especially the "Large" bin, to more directly pinpoint important thresholds. We could also look at the teacher-to-student ratio.

A second conclusion from the calculations is that, perhaps counterintuitively, when spending per student rises, average student test scores fall. This implies that whatever the additional student funding is being spent on does not directly benefit student learning in reading and math. We would need additional data to further investigate. It could be that the additional spending raised scores in other subjects or that it improved outcomes in extracurriculars. Another possibility is that the increased spending was not applied toward the classroom or extracurriculars but toward administration or other budgetary categories.
