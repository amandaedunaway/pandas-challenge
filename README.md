Module 4 Challenge

The "PyCitySchools" script merges two datasets of spending and standardized test outcomes. It creates new dataframes to find trends in school performance.

For this assignment, I recieved help from two BCS tutors: Matthew and Kelli. Matthew helped me with the School Summary section. He clarified when to use .groupby vs when to use loc. Kelli helped me with the following sections of the assignment, starting with "Highest-Performing Schools." She also gave me lots of tips for efficiency in VSCode, including the lines of code at the top of the script to hide messages about future version changes.
